2025.12.16 (patches by @badrelmers)
+ add: Optimization for faster caret placement: Implemented CARET_OPTION_NO_SORT to fix slow carets setting when switching from one ID to another in big files (speed went from 6s to instant for 20k carets).
* change: Improved fix for late lexer tokens parsing by replacing on_lexer_parsed with the new good API PROP_LEXER_BUSY (removed dependency on on_lexer_parsed event and related timers and its dirty workarounds).

2025.12.14 (patches by @badrelmers)
+ add: Big optimization for huge files: editing a word went from 48s to 0.0065s on 9mb file with 400k duplicates, and the first start scan went from 14min to 6s (issue #23)
+ add: Spatial Indexing for O(1) token lookup on large files.
+ add: Support for CudaText API PROC_EVENTS_SUB (sel, selreset) for zero-idle CPU/RAM usage.
+ add: Dynamic subscription to events (on_caret, on_scroll, on_key, on_click, etc.) to minimize resource usage.
* change: Markers (borders/backgrounds) now only render for the visible viewport (continous on scroll live updates).
* change: Implemented geometry-based length calculation for accurate token tracking.
* change: Gutter Icon now follows the viewport, ensuring it's always visible.
- fix: Solved the Caret problems: fixed all bugs related to caret jumping/movement after edits (issues #6, #7, #28).
- fix: Fixed logic for handling complete word/ID deletion during an edit session.
- fix: Resolved issues with the CudaText late lexer parsing for very large files.

2025.12.01 (by @badrelmers)
+ add: big optimization for huge files: e.g. 8Mb JavaScript file (if enabled by app's option "ui_max_size_lexer":9) is now processed ~30 times faster

2025.11.28 (patches by @badrelmers. Major Refactoring)
+ add: Continuous Edit mode (click a new word to switch editing immediately).

+ add: Gutter Icon activation/deactivation for improved workflow.
+ add: Optimized the core code for speed and performance.
* change: Unified configuration into a single INI file: `settings/cuda_sync_editing.ini`.
